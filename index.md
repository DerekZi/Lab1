In the word of Alan Cooper:
> You know, I’ve been in the software development business for more than 40 years now, and there is one thing that I know for a solid fact: Nobody knows how to build software. Yes, sometimes it gets built, but it’s a random, unrepeatable event. A lucky accident. \

I hope I can learn how the process of building a software should go by taking this class and get some experience for building a software. \
